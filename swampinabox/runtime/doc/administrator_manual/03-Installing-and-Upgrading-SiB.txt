Installing and Upgrading SWAMP-in-a-Box
---------------------------------------


Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


==== Before Installing a New SWAMP-in-a-Box ====

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

* The install script will prompt for the DNS hostname to use for the host.
  It must match the hostname that users will use to access the SWAMP web
  application and the hostname on the <<configure-ssl-certs,SSL certificate>>
  for the host's web server.

* The install script will prompt for the initial values to use for the
  following passwords, which can then be used to access the SWAMP web
  application and its SQL database:

  ** Database `root` password: This is the password for the SWAMP SQL
  database's `root` user. It may be different from the host operating
  system's `root` user's password, because the database maintains its own,
  separate collection of user accounts for accessing it.

+
[IMPORTANT]
*Do not forget this password. It is required to upgrade SWAMP-in-a-Box and
reset the passwords below.*

  ** Database web password: This is the password used by the SWAMP web
  application's backend to connect to the SQL database.

  ** Database SWAMP services password: This is the password used by
  SWAMP-in-a-Box's system daemons and backend processes to connect to the
  SQL database.

  ** SWAMP administrator account password: This is the password for the
  SWAMP web application's `admin-s` account, which is created during the
  install process and can be used to administer the SWAMP.


==== Before Upgrading an Existing SWAMP-in-a-Box ====

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box database.

* The SWAMP-in-a-Box host must currently have version 1.29 or later of
  SWAMP-in-a-Box installed. Upgrades from earlier versions are not supported
  and will likely result in a non-working system. Older systems should first
  be upgraded to 1.29 or 1.30, before upgrading them to a more recent
  version.

[IMPORTANT]
*Back up any customizations. The SWAMP-in-a-Box upgrade process will
overwrite existing SWAMP files.* Add on Tools, Platforms, and Viewers will
be retained, as will customizations made to SWAMP-in-a-Box via configuration
files (.env, config.json, swamp.conf, and services.conf). Any other
customizations you have made by modifying SWAMP files will need to be
reimplemented after an upgrade.


Run `yum update`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend running `yum update` (as `root` or using `sudo`) to ensure that
any software currently installed on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host is up-to-date.
This is especially important when there has been a new release of the host's
operating system since the host was initially set up. In this case, the
steps below will likely cause a partial update to the new release, which
might leave the host in an inconsistent and non-working state.

[IMPORTANT]
When upgrading a SWAMP-in-a-Box that was originally installed with
SWAMP-in-a-Box version 1.33.4 or earlier, `yum update` may fail with an 
error related to the package `condor-std-universe`. To resolve this issue, 
first remove any version locks by running `yum versionlock clear` (as `root`
or using `sudo`). Then uninstall the HTCondor packages by running 
`yum remove 'condor*'` (as `root` or using `sudo`).


Obtain the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit https://github.com/mirswamp/deployment for instructions on how to
download SWAMP-in-a-Box as a pre-packaged installer, which is what the
instructions below assume you are working with.


Extract the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, move or copy the following files into the same
directory (for example, a user's home directory):

  * `extract-installer.bash`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-installer.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-platforms.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-tools.tar.gz`

From that directory, run `extract-installer.bash`:

----
bash extract-installer.bash
----

When the script completes successfully, it will display the location of the
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer. The instructions below use `<installer-dir>` to
refer to that directory.


Install/Upgrade Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory `<installer-dir>/repos` contains set up scripts that will

  * configure package repositories,
  * install dependencies,
  * enable required services, and
  * create required user accounts.

Even if you have gone through this step on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host for
a previous release of SWAMP-in-a-Box, it is important to run the scripts for
the current release as they will ensure that the correct versions of
SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies are installed.

If your host has unrestricted access to the internet, as `root` (or using
`sudo`), run the `install-all.bash` script:

----
<installer-dir>/repos/install-all.bash
----

If your host has restricted access to the internet, or if you run into
issues with running `install-all.bash`, refer to the
<<installing-dependencies,appendix on installing SWAMP-in-a-Box's
dependencies>>. This appendix lists the dependencies in detail, so that you
can determine how best to install them, and provides other troubleshooting
guidance. Continue with the steps below after the dependencies have been
installed.


Run the Main Install/Upgrade Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As `root` (or using `sudo`):

* If you are installing a new SWAMP-in-a-Box, run the following script:

+
----
<installer-dir>/bin/install_swampinabox.bash
----

* If you are upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, run the following script:

+
----
<installer-dir>/bin/upgrade_swampinabox.bash
----

You will be prompted for the passwords and other information listed above.
Output will be saved to a log file in `<installer-dir>/log`, a copy of which
can be found in `/opt/swamp/log`. If the install or upgrade process is
unsuccessful, the log file will be helpful in determining the cause.

At the end of the install or upgrade process, the script will check for and
warn about many common problems (refer to the section on
<<checking-sib-health,checking the host's health>> for details). When
installing a new SWAMP-in-a-Box, you might see a warning that the host does
not appear to have a valid SSL certificate because you have not yet
<<configure-ssl-certs,configured an SSL certificate>>. If this is the only
warning, then the SWAMP should function correctly, though users might have
to click through a warning in their browser stating that the web site is
insecure.

When upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, the upgrade script will use
`mysqldump` to create a backup of the SWAMP's databases before making any
modifications to them. The database dumps will be stored in the following
files, which can be found in the directory from which you run the upgrade:

  * `bkup_all_databases.<YYYY_MM_DD>.sql`
  * `bkup_information_schema.<YYYY_MM_DD>.sql`


Add at least one Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new installation of SWAMP-in-a-Box does not initially include any 
assessment platforms. A SWAMP-in-a-Box installation upgraded from a 
previous version will retain any supported platform versions, but the
upgrade process will delete any unsupported platform versions. Therefore
it is also possible that an upgraded SWAMP-in-a-Box will have no Platforms
available for assessments.

Please refer to <<add-on-platforms,Installing Assessment Platforms>> for the
procedure to add one or more platforms.


Verify that the Install/Upgrade Was Successful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://<SWAMP-in-a-Box-hostname>/.

2. Sign in to the SWAMP with the administrator account (username: `admin-s`).

3. Upload a package, create and run a new assessment of it, and view the
results. Several small, sample packages known to work with the SWAMP can be
found in `<installer-dir>/sample_packages`. The `README.txt` file in that
directory provides basic information about the samples.


Check for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, refer to the section on
<<checking-for-updates,checking for updates>> to determine whether there are
components that still need to be upgraded. The SWAMP-in-a-Box upgrade script
does not necessarily upgrade all components of SWAMP-in-a-Box for which
a newer version might be available.
