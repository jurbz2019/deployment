What Is SWAMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP) is a continuous software
assurance platform for running software assurance tools on your code. It was
a joint effort of four research institutions -- the Morgridge Institute for
Research, Indiana University, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison -- to advance the
capabilities and increase the adoption of software assurance technologies
through an open continuous assurance facility. The SWAMP originally went
live in February 2014 as a web application, where it provided continuous
software assurance capabilities to developers and researchers.

The SWAMP project was funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Science and Technology Directorate, Homeland Security Advanced Research
Projects Agency, Cyber Security Division (DHS S&T/HSARPA/CSD); BAA 11-02;
and the Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate under
agreement number FA8750-12-2-0289.


What Is SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For users that need or prefer to run software assurance tools on their own
computing infrastructure, SWAMP-in-a-Box (SiB) is a standalone software
application for continuous software assurance. It is, in essence, a local
instance of a continuous assurance platform, originally created by the SWAMP
project, that can be deployed on your own servers if you have higher
security or compliance requirements for your software, or, being
open-source, when you want to customize the software.


Obtaining SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box is currently available as an open beta. Visit
https://github.com/mirswamp/deployment for instructions on how to download
SWAMP-in-a-Box as a pre-packaged installer or as source code.


Documentation for SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copies of this SWAMP-in-a-Box Administrator Manual and the SWAMP-in-a-Box
Reference Manual can be found at
https://platform.swampinabox.org/siab-latest-release/. They are additionally
available in `/opt/swamp/doc` on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host after
SWAMP-in-a-Box has been installed. Each manual is available as a single page
HTML document and as a PDF.

Documentation for users of the SWAMP is available on the Help page of the
SWAMP web application after SWAMP-in-a-Box has been installed.
