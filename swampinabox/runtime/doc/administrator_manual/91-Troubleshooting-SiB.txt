Troubleshooting SWAMP-in-a-Box
------------------------------


[[checking-sib-health]]
Checking the Host's Health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box includes a script, `swamp_check_install`, for checking that
its components are functioning as expected. Run this script as the first
step in troubleshooting issues with the SWAMP web application or
assessments, because it checks for and warns about many common problems.

To run the script, run the following command as `root` (or using `sudo`),
replacing `<hostname>` with the hostname for your SWAMP-in-a-Box's web
application (for example, `swamp.example.com`):

----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_check_install --hostname "<hostname>"
----

The script will display information about the checks it is performing and
summarize its findings. The meanings of any warnings and errors, and
potential remedies for them, are described below.

[TIP]
====
If you are unable to resolve your issue, <<support-and-contact-info,contact
SWAMP staff>>. Include the full output from the script and SWAMP-in-a-Box's
log files. Refer to the section below on <<collecting-log-files,collecting
log files>> for instructions on how to bundle SWAMP-in-a-Box's logs into
a single archive.

==== Messages About the SQL Database ====

The mysql system service is not running::

Indicates that the database server is not running, which will prevent the
web application and assessments from functioning correctly. Start the
service by running the following command as `root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service mysql restart
----

Failed to connect to the SQL database::

Indicates that the libraries used by the SWAMP's backend are unable to
establish a connection to the database. If you have recently changed the
password for the database's `java_agent` user, update the `dbPerlPass`
setting in `/opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf` with the new password (you will need
`root` access to edit this file).


[[checking-sib-health-htcondor]]
==== Messages About HTCondor ====

Any HTCondor-related warnings and errors indicate an issue that is likely
preventing the SWAMP from performing assessments and running the
<<add-on-viewers,optional Code Dx viewer>>.

The condor system service is not running::

Indicates that HTCondor is not running. This is likely the cause of any
other HTCondor-related warnings and errors found by `swamp_check_install`.
Start the service by running the following command as `root` (or using
`sudo`):

+
----
service condor restart
----

+
Note that it normally takes a few minutes for HTCondor's daemons to start up.

'condor_q ...' exited with ...::
'condor_status ...' exited with ...::

Indicates that HTCondor is misconfigured.
<<support-and-contact-info,Contact SWAMP staff>>.

The HTCondor pool has no resources for running jobs::

Indicates that HTCondor is misconfigured.
<<support-and-contact-info,Contact SWAMP staff>>.

The HTCondor pool has no resources for running VM jobs::

Indicates that HTCondor is unable to run jobs which require a virtual
machine, which will prevent the SWAMP from performing assessments and
running the <<add-on-viewers,optional Code Dx viewer>>.

+
If `swamp_check_install` also indicated issues with `libvirtd` (see the list
of <<checking-sib-health-libvirtd,messages about libvirtd>> below), resolve
those first.

+
Otherwise, run the following script to determine whether the SWAMP-in-a-Box
host supports KVM virtualization, as described in the
<<hardware-requirements,hardware requirements>> for SWAMP-in-a-Box:

+
----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_check_virtualization_support
----

+
If the script does _not_ find the necessary support for KVM virtualization,
it will display an error message and a suggestion on how to resolve the
issue.

+
If the script _does_ find the necessary support for KVM virtualization, then
what likely happened is that some job failed to start its virtual machine
successfully. The immediate cause of the failure might be listed in
`/var/log/condor/VMGahpLog` (look around the times an assessment was
submitted or failed).

+
In any event, restart the `condor` service by running the following command
as `root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service condor restart
----

+
Note that it normally takes a few minutes for HTCondor's daemons to start up.

+
If this error from `swamp_check_install` persists, then there is likely
a systemic issue that requires further investigation.
<<support-and-contact-info,Contact SWAMP staff>>.

The HTCondor queue has ... held jobs::

Indicates that one or more HTCondor jobs encountered an unexpected error.
Use the `condor_q` command, as described in the section on
<<managing-htcondor,managing HTCondor>>, to determine why HTCondor put the
job on-hold. Then <<support-and-contact-info,contact SWAMP staff>>.


[[checking-sib-health-libvirtd]]
==== Messages About libvirtd ====

The libvirtd system service is not running::

Indicates that the `libvirtd` service is not running, which will prevent the
SWAMP from performing assessments and running the <<add-on-viewers,optional
Code Dx viewer>>. Start the service by running the following command as
`root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service libvirtd restart
----

+
If `swamp_check_install` also indicated issues with HTCondor (see the list
of <<checking-sib-health-htcondor,messages about HTCondor>> above), also
restart the `condor` system service by running the following command as
`root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service condor restart
----

+
Note that it normally takes a few minutes for HTCondor's daemons to start up.

Failed to find SWAMP's libvirt iptables rules::

+
Indicates that the firewall rules that allow assessment virtual machines to
access the host's network are absent, which will prevent assessments from
doing anything that requires network access, such as contacting license
servers. Restart the `libvirtd` service by running the following command as
`root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service libvirtd restart
----


==== Messages About SWAMP Daemons ====

The swamp system service is not running::

Indicates that the `swamp` system service is not running, which will prevent
the SWAMP from performing assessments and running the
<<add-on-viewers,optional Code Dx viewer>>. Start the service by running the
following command as `root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service swamp restart
----

RPC to AgentMonitor failed::
RPC to LaunchPad failed::
RPC to AgentMonitor returned something unexpected::
RPC to LaunchPad returned something unexpected::

Indicates that one or both of the SWAMP daemons necessary for running
assessments is not running correctly. <<support-and-contact-info,Contact
SWAMP staff>>.


==== Messages About the Web Application ====

The httpd system service is not running::

Indicates that the web server is not running, which will prevent everyone
from accessing the SWAMP web application. Start the web server by running
the following command as `root` (or using `sudo`):

+
----
service httpd restart
----

Failed to connect to 'http(s)://<hostname>'::

Indicates that the web server for the SWAMP web application is not
reachable. If the web server is not running on the host (see the message
directly above), resolve that issue first. Otherwise, refer to the section
on <<configure-firewalls,configuring the host's firewall>>.

'<hostname>' does not appear to support https::

Indicates that the web server does not support encrypted connections, which
means that any information, including usernames and passwords, sent between
the SWAMP web application and the web server will *not* be encrypted.

+
By default, SWAMP-in-a-Box configures the web server to support only
encrypted connections (HTTPS). If you intentionally disabled this support,
then you can ignore this message. Otherwise,
<<support-and-contact-info,contact SWAMP staff>>.

'<hostname>' might not have a valid SSL certificate::

Indicates that the web server does not have a properly signed SSL
certificate that matches `<hostname>`. Refer to the section on
<<configure-ssl-certs,configuring an SSL certificate for SWAMP-in-a-Box>>.

'http(s)://<hostname>/config/config.json' is not valid JSON::

Indicates that `/var/www/html/config/config.json` on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host
does not contain valid JSON, which will cause the SWAMP web application to
appear stuck on a "loading" screen. Check this file for typos.

'http(s)://<hostname>/config/config.json' does not define 'servers.web'::

Indicates that `/var/www/html/config/config.json` on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host
does not contain the configuration key that specifies the location of the
SWAMP API (i.e., SWAMP backend). Follow the directions in the section on
<<updating-the-hostname,updating the host's hostname>>, which will, as
a side effect, set the required configuration key.

Failed to fetch '<api-location>/environment'::
Failed to fetch '<api-location>/platforms/public'::
'<api-location>/platforms/public' is not valid JSON::

Indicates that SWAMP API is not functioning correctly. First, resolve the
other errors reported by `swamp_check_install`, if any. If these errors
persist, then <<support-and-contact-info,contact SWAMP staff>>.

==== Other Messages ====

Failed to determine PHP version::

Indicates that the script was unable to determine the version of the PHP
command line interpreter that is installed on the host.

+
If the SWAMP web application is _not_ functioning as expected, it is likely
that the wrong version of PHP is installed. Refer to the appendix on
<<dependencies-php,installing PHP>> for instructions on installing the
required version of PHP.

+
If the SWAMP web application _is_ functioning as expected, then this message
can be ignored. However, feel free to <<support-and-contact-info,contact
SWAMP staff>> and provide the full output from `swamp_check_install` so that
they can work on removing this false positive from future versions of the
script.

Found PHP ..., not 7.*::

Indicates that the script found an unsupported version of PHP installed on
the host. Refer to the appendix on <<dependencies-php,installing PHP>> for
instructions on installing the required version of PHP.


[[collecting-log-files]]
Collecting Log Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When investigating an issue with SWAMP-in-a-Box, SWAMP staff often find it
helpful to review:

* The SWAMP's log files (located in `/opt/swamp/log`)
* HTCondor's log files (located in `/var/log/condor`)
* HTCondor's configuration files (located in `/etc/condor`)

To bundle all of these files into a single archive, run the following command:

----
tar -cvz -f swampinabox-logs.tar.gz --exclude="*.old" \
    /opt/swamp/log/*.log \
    /var/log/condor/*Log \
    /var/log/condor/*Log.slot* \
    /etc/condor
----

This will create a file `swampinabox-logs.tar.gz` in the current working
directory. Errors from `tar` about `No such file or directory` may safely be
ignored (some of the files that the command looks for might not exist on all
systems).


Debugging Failed Assessments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an assessment reaches a status of "Finished with Errors," the SWAMP is
functioning normally, but the assessment failed to yield any results. Click
the "Error" button to view a detailed report about the failure.

The primary error is listed at the top of the Error Information section of
the report followed by the full content of status.out.

Details about the primary error can be found in the document: "SWAMP Output
Files and Debugging Failures" (formerly called, "Status.out and Debugging
SWAMP Failures"). You can access a PDF or HTML version of this document
following links provided in the Error Report. Links are also provided on the
SWAMP-in-a-Box Help page.

Depending on the primary error, you can also jump to the relevant section of
"SWAMP Output Files and Debugging Failures" by clicking the link for the
primary error.

Additional content may be displayed in the Error Information section of the
Error Report depending on the primary error.

This may include the following:

* Contents of build_stderr.out

* Contents of build_assess.out

* Contents of stderr

* Contents of stdout

If an assessment reaches some other error state (other than "Finished with
Errors"), the assessment's log file might indicate why:

1. On the Assessment Results page of the SWAMP web application, click on the
assessment's status. Locate the execution record UUID.

2. The assessment's log file will be located at
`/opt/swamp/log/<execution-record-UUID>.log` on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.


Debugging Assessment Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an assessment reaches a status of "Finished with Warnings," the SWAMP is
functioning normally and results are available for the assessment, but it
is possible that the results are incomplete. Click the "Warning" button to
view a detailed report.

The primary warning is listed at the top of the Warning Information section
of the report followed by the full content of status.out.

For Java and C/C++ No Build packages, a warning status may indicate that not
all code files in the build directory could be compiled. In this case the
primary warning will indicate that the number of expected source file was
greater than the number compilable. Additional content in the Warning
Information section of the report then lists the Source Files, including
those that compiled successfully and those that failed.

For assessments of other package types, representing non-compilable languages,
a warning may indicate that there were no files found to assess.

As in the Error report, the Warning report includes links to the document:
"SWAMP Output Files and Debugging Failures" (formerly called, "Status.out
and Debugging SWAMP Failures").


Debugging Stuck Assessments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an assessment appears stuck at a status of "Waiting in HTCondor Queue" or
is unable to be submitted to HTCondor, refer back to the section on
<<checking-sib-health,checking the host's health>>. Otherwise, it is
possible to log into the Docker container or virtual machine that is running
the assessment in order to examine its running processes and file system.

.Logging into a Docker-Based Assessment

1. On the Assessment Results page of the SWAMP web application, click on the
   assessment's status. Locate the execution record UUID.

2. On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, login as `root`, or run `sudo -i`.

3. Run the following command:

+
----
condor_q -constraint 'SWAMP_arun_execrunuid == "UUID"'
----

+
where `UUID` is replaced with execution record UUID from step 1. Exactly one
job should be listed. Note the Job ID.

4. Run the following command:

+
----
condor_q -long <Job ID> | grep slot
----

+
where `<Job ID>` is replaced with the Job ID you noted in the previous step.
The output should indicate that the `RemoteHost` for the job is
`slotNNN@...`. Note the `slotNNN` part.

5. Run the following command:

+
----
docker ps --filter name=slotNNN
----

+
where `slotNNN` comes from the `RemoteHost` identified in the previous step.
The output should list exactly one container. Note its ID.

6. Run the following command:

+
----
docker exec -i <Container ID> /bin/bash -i
----

+
where `<Container ID>` is replaced with the one you identified in the
previous step.

At this point, you should have a shell running inside the container.

.Logging into a Virtual Machine-Based Assessment

If an assessment appears stuck at a status of "Shutting down the VM," it is
likely that the assessment's virtual machine has encountered an issue. At
this point, the assessment has completed its work; all that remains is to
extract its output from the virtual machine, which requires that the virtual
machine be shut down.

To force the virtual machine to shut down:

1. On the Assessment Results page of the SWAMP web application, click on the
assessment's status. Locate the execution record UUID.

2. As a SWAMP administrator, go to the System Overview page, and from there,
to the Review Status page.

3. Under the Condor Queue tab, locate the row for the assessment's execution
run UUID. Note the virtual machine's name in the VM column.

4. On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, as `root` (or using `sudo`), run `virsh`.
This will start a shell that can be used to interact with the virtual
machines currently running on the host. Available commands include:

+
--
`list`::

Displays a list of all the virtual machines currently being managed by `libvirt`.

`console <id>`::
`console <virtual-machine-name>`::

Connects to a virtual machine's console.
Type control-] to detach from the console.

`destroy <id>`::
`destroy <virtual-machine-name>`::

Immediately shuts down and stops a virtual machine.

`exit`::

Exits the `virsh` shell.
--

5. Use the `destroy` command, as described above, to shut down the virtual
machine. The SWAMP should finish processing the assessment and make its
results available in the SWAMP web application.
