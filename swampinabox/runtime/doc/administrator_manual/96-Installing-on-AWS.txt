Installing on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance
------------------------------------------------------

The <<system-requirements,system requirements>> and
<<installing-sib,installation instructions>> for SWAMP-in-a-Box are
generally applicable to using an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instance as the SWAMP-in-a-Box host. This appendix calls out several
considerations specific to Amazon EC2.


Documentation for Amazon EC2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Administrator Manual assumes that you have an Amazon Web Services (AWS)
account and some experience working with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2). If you are just getting started, the following resources might
be helpful:

  * https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html
  * https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/


[[configure-ec2-instance]]
Configuring an EC2 Instance that Supports SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any instance that meets SWAMP-in-a-Box's <<system-requirements,system
requirements>> should work.

* Access the AWS Management Console.

* Select the option to "Launch a virtual machine."

* For "Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)", search for "CentOS" in the
  AWS Marketplace and select "CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with Updates HVM".

* For "Choose an Instance Type", pick an option based on the Hardware
  Requirements section of the SWAMP-in-a-Box Administrator Manual.
  In general SWAMP-in-a-Box requires 2 cores and 6 GiB of Memory for
  each simultaneous assessment run. The SWAMP team has successfully
  run SWAMP-in-a-Box on the following instance types:

** t3a.xlarge (4 core, 16 GiB memory)
** m5a.2xlarge (8 core, 32 GiB memory)

* For "Configure Instance", ensure that the instance is configured to be
  assigned a public IP address. Specifically, under Configure Instance
  Details, set "Auto-assign Public IP" to "Enable".

* For "Add Storage", the "Root" Volume Type should have a size of at least
  64 GiB. There is no need to add any other volume. Note that for
  experimental purposes, you can configure the instance with as little as
  48 GiB of storage space. For anything less than that there will not be
  sufficient space to complete the install and run assessments.

* For "Configure Security Group", SWAMP-in-a-Box requires inbound rules
  allowing SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. By default, SWAMP-in-a-Box does not allow
  access over HTTP, but for instances where you might be unable or unwilling
  to obtain SSL certifications signed by a trusted authority,
  <<configure-http,enabling HTTP access>> might be necessary and acceptable.


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Hostname Does Not Remain Fixed

Unless you have a static IP address (Elastic IP) for your AWS Instance, you
will get a new IP address, and therefore a new DNS name every time you stop
and start your instance. In this case you will need to reconfigure
SWAMP-in-a-Box with the new hostname every time you re-start your Instance.
You will also, then have a different URL to access the SWAMP-in-a-Box
website. See the section on <<updating-the-hostname>> for instructions on
how to update the hostname through SWAMP-in-a-Box's configuration files.

.Default Self-Signed SSL Certificate is Rejected by Browsers

The default AWS Instance configuration includes an automatically generated
SSL certificate which will appear to web browsers to be suspicious. When
you first access your SWAMP-in-a-Box on an AWS instance via your web browser,
the browser will display a warning page. In most cases you can override the
warning and proceed, but if one browser does not work for you, please try
another.

- In Firefox: Click "Advanced..." and then click the link "Accept the Risk
  and Continue" to access the site.

- In Google Chrome: Click "Advanced". There may be a link,
  "Proceed to <site url> (unsafe)", if so, click it to access the site.
  If there is no link to access the site you may still be able to access the
  site by typing "thisisunsafe" while the browser window has focus.

- In Safari: Click "Show Details" and then click "Visit this website". You
  will then need to confirm and enter your Mac OS username and password
  to make changes to your Certificate Trust Settings. You will then be
  redirected to the site. This may only work if your Mac OS account is also
  an Administrator account.

- In Microsoft Edge: Click "Details" and then click "Go on to the webpage"
  to access the site.

.Code Dx Cannot Be Installed

Currently, SWAMP-in-a-Box is limited to running <<add-on-viewers,optional
Code Dx results viewer>> only in a virtual machine. Unfortunately, EC2
instances do not support running virtual machines.
