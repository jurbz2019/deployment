Configuring HTTP Access to SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For situations where it is not possible to <<configure-ssl-certs,configure
SWAMP-in-a-Box with an SSL certificate signed by a trusted authority>>, you
can configure SWAMP-in-a-Box to allow access over HTTP.

[WARNING]
====
This is *not* a recommended configuration for SWAMP-in-a-Box. All network
traffic to and from the SWAMP-in-a-Box, *including passwords* used to log
into the SWAMP, will *not* be encrypted.

This configuration is appropriate only for situations where network traffic
to and from SWAMP-in-a-Box is restricted to a trusted network, or situations
where every user is using a username and password unique to the SWAMP and
does not care whether unknown third parties snoop on their packages and
assessments.
====


==== Before You Begin ====

* You need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.


==== Procedure ====

1. As `root`, or using `sudo`, edit `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.

2. Enable HTTP access to SWAMP-in-a-Box's web server by finding the line
   `\#Listen 80` and changing it so that it reads `Listen 80` (i.e., remove
   the `#` at the beginning of the line).

3. As `root`, or using `sudo`, edit `/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env`.

4. Configure the SWAMP to allow insecure session cookies by finding the line
   `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` and changing it so that it reads
   `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false` (i.e., change `true` to `false`).

5. As `root`, or using `sudo`, restart the web server by running `service
   httpd restart`.
